# SmartSight AI: IoT Sensor Data RAG for Smart Buildings

SmartSight AI is a comprehensive Next.js application designed to provide a centralized dashboard for monitoring and managing smart building data. It leverages the power of generative AI to offer intelligent insights, including a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chat for querying building documentation, real-time anomaly detection, and actionable efficiency recommendations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Live Telemetry Dashboard**: Visualize real-time data from various IoT sensors, including temperature, energy consumption, air quality, and vibration levels.
*   **Anomaly Detection**: Automatically identifies and alerts on unusual sensor readings, helping to preemptively address potential issues.
*   **RAG Chat**: An AI-powered chat interface that allows users to ask natural language questions about building procedures, maintenance manuals, and specifications.
*   **AI-Driven Recommendations**: Receive intelligent suggestions for optimizing energy consumption, scheduling predictive maintenance, and improving overall operational efficiency.
*   **Document Management**: A centralized repository for uploading, indexing, and managing crucial building documents like manuals and specifications.
*   **Performance Evaluation**: A dedicated view to monitor and evaluate the performance metrics of the underlying AI and RAG models.
*   **Responsive Design**: A fully responsive interface that works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
